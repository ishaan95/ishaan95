### Welcome to my GithubðŸ‘‹! 

I'm a PhD student in the Computational Media department at University of California, Santa Cruz. This github is where all of my project code lives. I'm currently working on procedurally creating test scenarios for testing autonomous vehicles. My pinned repositories are the major projects I've worked on. A central access point for my other profiles and contact details are on [my website](https://ishaan95.github.io/).
